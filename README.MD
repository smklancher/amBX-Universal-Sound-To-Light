# Universal Sound to Light

I used to have a set of [amBX gaming lights](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DKZSVS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B005DKZSVS&linkCode=as2&tag=medimome-20) and wanted to play with the SDK. Out of the box they work quite well for any game, even if the game wasn't designed for it. Music was a little more restrictive because you had a to have a plugin for the specific player, so this excluded web sources of music.

I started trying to make a utility that would work with sound from any source. I did get it to work, but before I got to far I found [Aurora Synesthesia](https://github.com/ZodiusInfuser/AuroraSynesthesia) which was a much better implmentation of the idea than I could ever do.
